			As you write your JavaScript code, please remember that JavaScript is not
			as forgiving as HTML. If you code something wrong, your Web page generates
			an error. Be patient and keep these things in mind when coding JavaScript.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>JavaScript is case sensitive</li>
			<li>JavaScript is white-space sensitive (enters matter)</li>
			<li>JavaScript is sensitive to apostrophes (or single quotes)</li>
			<li>JavaScript lines should end with a semi-colon</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The browser window contains other objects, such as the document object.
			You can refer to the document object by using "window.object." The
			following is a method (action) of the document object. This method is
			called by using the following code:
		</p>

		<p>window.document.write();</p>

		<p>
			Here's the code to dynamically write the first two sentences of this Web
			page:
		</p>

		<pre class="line-numbers">
	<code class="language-javascript">
	window.document.write("&lt;p class='highlight'&gt; I am using JavaScript to write the opening to this page.  This text has been created by using JavaScripit window.document.write() &lt;/p&gt;");
	</code>
